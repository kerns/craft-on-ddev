# Craft on DDEV

Dockerized local development for Craft CMS, pre-configured with Vite and built on DDEV.

## Features:

- [DDEV](https://ddev.com/get-started/) for local development in a Docker setup that just works
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for HMR + live reloading for development, asset optimization + bundling for production
- [Tailwind 3.x](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility-first CSS
- [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/) for lightweight reactivity
- [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/) for automated deployment
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for email delivery
- [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for common CLI commands

## Requirements:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [DDEV](https://ddev.com/)
3. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Getting Started

Make sure you have installed Docker, DDEV and Composer before continuing.

* Docker Desktop - Visit [docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* DDEV - Visit [ddev.com/get-started/](https://ddev.com/get-started/)
* Composer - You could visit [getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) but if you're using macOS and already running Homebrew, simply run `brew install composer`.

With that behind you, open a terminal prompt and run:

```shell
composer create-project kerns/craft-on-ddev <YOUR PATH HERE> --no-install
```

Make sure that `<YOUR PATH HERE>` is the location of a **new** or **existing and empty** folder.
 

## Configuring DDEV

You could skip this step if you're happy settling for the default domain, `https://craftcms.ddev.site`. But cool kidz don't settle for default domains. Demonstrate your commitment to this project by specifying a custom domain. Do so by running:

```shell
ddev config
```

Follow the prompts.

- **Project name:** e.g. `my-website` would result in a project URL of `https://my-website.ddev.site` (make note of this for later when you're setting up Craft)
- **Docroot location:** defaults to `web` and should be kept as-is
- **Project Type:** defaults to `php` and should be kept as-is

## Installing Craft

Finally, to install a clean version of Craft, run the following command and follow the prompts.

```shell
make install
```

This does the heavy lifting of spinning up and configuring a sane, Dockerized development environment running the latest version of Craft CMS. It also installs a selection of plugins for Craft as defined in `composer.json.default`. You can edit/expand this list however you like, just remember to mirror those choices in your `Makefile`.

**Pay special attention to the Craft installation prompts**. After setting the admin's account credentials, you'll be prompted for your desired site name and url.

Note that the url defaults to `https://craftcms.ddev.site`. If you ran `ddev config` and specified a custom name for your project (e.g. "my-project"), then the url of your project has been changed accordingly. Answer this prompt with that full url (ðŸ˜Ž e.g. `https://my-website.ddev.site`).

_ðŸ’¡ If you're unclear or forgot to note the url, open another terminal window in the same directory and run `ddev describe`_


## Local Development with Vite

To begin development with Vite's dev server run:

```shell
make dev
```

This command will:

1. Copy your local SSH keys into the right container (handy if you are setting up [craft-scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts/) or just want to shell into your project's container later with `ddev ssh` )
2. (Re)Start your DDEV project (a series of networked Docker containers)
3. (Re)Install the container's versions of Composer and npm, together with all their dependencies
4. Instruct Vite to perform a one-time build for production (output in `/web/dist`)
5. Finally, start a Vite dev server for HMR and live reloading

Edit the default `index.twig` file in `templates/` to confirm that changes are being pushed to your browser. (ðŸ’¡ `ddev launch` opens a browser pointed to the domain of your Craft project. Like all project specific DDEV commands, it can be run from any location below your project's root directory.)

Subsequently, you can save some time just running `ddev exec npm run serve` to initiate your Vite dev server. But after a `git pull` or other big changes to the codebase you'll want to re-run `make dev`.

Likewise, to build assets for use in production, stop your Vite server and run `ddev exec npm run build`. But run `make build` periodically or after pulling down major changes.


## Makefile

A Makefile has been included to provide a unified CLI for common development commands.

- `make install` - Runs a complete one-time process to set the project up and install Craft.
- `make up` - Starts the DDEV project, ensuring that SSH keys have been added, and npm & Composer have been installed.
- `make dev` - Runs a one-time build of all front-end assets, then starts Vite's server for HMR and live reloading.
- `make build` - Builds all front-end assets.
- `make composer xxx` - Run Composer commands inside the container, e.g. `make composer install`
- `make craft xxx` - Run Craft commands inside the container, e.g. `make craft project-config/touch`
- `make npm xxx` - Run npm commands inside the container, e.g. `make npm install`
- `make pull` - Pull remote db & assets (requires setting up [craft-scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts/)

## Craft CMS Plugins

[Vite](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite) and [Postmark](https://plugins.craftcms.com/postmark) are the only two plugins currently installed by default. You can edit `composer.json.default` prior to running `make install` to add or remove plugins to your installation â€“ just remember to mirror those choices in your `Makefile`.

_ðŸ’¡Note that many plugins require an additional configuration file in `/config`._
