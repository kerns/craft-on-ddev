## Craft on DDEV

A DDEV installation tuned for local development with Craft CMS â€“Â pre-configured with Vite for HMR, live reloading and asset bundling.

## Features:

- [DDEV](https://ddev.com/get-started/) Configuration â€“Â for time-saving, sanity-preserving local development with Docker
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for HMR, live reloading and front-end bundling
- [Tailwind 3.x](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility-first CSS
- [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/) for lightweight reactivity
- [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/) for automated deployment
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for email delivery
- [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for common CLI commands

## Requirements:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [DDEV](https://ddev.com/)
3. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Getting Started

Assuming you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your local machine, you can use the `create-project` command to kickoff a new project. If you don't have Composer, please [get Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Mac users running Homebrew can simply run `brew install composer`.

With that behind you, open a terminal prompt and run:

```shell
composer create-project kerns/craft-on-ddev <YOUR PATH HERE> --no-install
```

Make sure that `<YOUR PATH HERE>` is the location of a **new** or **existing and empty** folder.
 

## Configuring DDEV (Optional)

You could skip this step if you're happy using the default domain, `https://craftcms.ddev.site`. But cool kids don't settle for default domains. Demonstrate your commitment to this project by specifying a custom domain. Do so by running:

```shell
ddev config
```

Follow the prompts.

- **Project name:** e.g. `cool-kids-website` would result in a project URL of `https://cool-kids-website.ddev.site` (make note of this for later when you're setting up Craft)
- **Docroot location:** defaults to `web` and should be kept as-is
- **Project Type:** defaults to `php` and should be kept as-is

## Installing Craft

Finally, to install a clean version of Craft, run the following command and follow the prompts.

```shell
make install
```

This does the heavy lifting of spinning up and configuring a sane, Dockerized development environment with a new and pre-tuned installation of Craft CMS.

Part of that tuning involves the installation of plugins for Craft as defined in `composer.json.default`. You can edit/expand this list however you like, just remember to mirror those choices in your `Makefile`.

Pay special attention to the Craft installation prompts. After setting the admin's account credentials, you'll be prompted for your desired site name and url.

Note that the url defaults to `https://craftcms.ddev.site`, making the assumption that you are not cool and did not run `ddev config` to specify a custom name for your project. Remember to update this with the full url if you ran `ddev config` to specify a custom domain. (for ex. `https://cool-kids-website.ddev.site` ðŸ˜Ž).

(ðŸ’¡ If you forgot to note the url open another terminal window in the same directory and run `ddev describe`)

Once the process is complete, type `ddev launch` to open the project in your default browser. ðŸš€

## Local Development with Vite

To begin development with Vite's dev server run:

```shell
make dev
```

This command will:

1. Copy your local SSH keys into the right container (handy if you are setting up [craft-scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts/) or just want to shell into your project's container later with `ddev ssh` )
2. (Re)Start your DDEV project (a series of networked Docker containers)
3. (Re)Install the container's versions of Composer and npm, together with their dependencies
4. Instruct Vite to perform a one-time build for production (output in /web/dist)
5. Finally, start a Vite dev server for HMR and live reloading

Edit code in `src/` or `templates/` to confirm that changes are being pushed to your browser. (ðŸ’¡ `ddev launch` opens a browser pointed to the domain of your Craft project. It works from any location below your project's root directory.)

Subsequently, you can save some time just running `ddev exec npm run serve` to initiate your Vite dev server, but after a `git pull` or other big changes to the codebase you'll want to re-run `make dev`.

Similarly, to build assets for use in production, stop your Vite server and run `ddev exec npm run build`. But run `make build` periodically or after pulling down major changes.


## Makefile

A Makefile has been included to provide a unified CLI for common development commands.

- `make install` - Runs a complete one-time process to set the project up and install Craft.
- `make up` - Starts the DDEV project, ensuring that SSH keys have been added, and npm & Composer have been installed.
- `make dev` - Runs a one-time build of all front-end assets, then starts Vite's server for HMR and live reloading.
- `make build` - Builds all front-end assets.
- `make composer xxx` - Run Composer commands inside the container, e.g. `make composer install`
- `make craft xxx` - Run Craft commands inside the container, e.g. `make craft project-config/touch`
- `make npm xxx` - Run npm commands inside the container, e.g. `make npm install`
- `make pull` - Pull remote db & assets (requires setting up [craft-scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts/)

## Craft CMS Plugins

Note that [Vite](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite) and [Postmark](https://plugins.craftcms.com/postmark) are the only two plugins currently installed by default. You can edit `composer.json.default` prior to running `make install` to add or remove plugins to your installation â€“ just remember to mirror those choices in your `Makefile`.


## Tailwind Plugins

1. [Aspect Ratio](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-aspect-ratio)
1. [Line Clamp](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-line-clamp)
1. [Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)
1. [Forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) (* Beta)

## Javascript Libraries

1. [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/)
1. [Lazysizes](https://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/)


## Roadmap
- Tailwind 3
- Thin out the plugins
- Add some more commands
- Improve default typography
- Add some basic user management
